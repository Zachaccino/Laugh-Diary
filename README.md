# Laugh Diary

This is a team project with Tim Bunnage and Benjamin De Worsop. 

I am responsible for designing, implementing, training, and transferring a CNN model that recognises laughs using MFCC. Then, I took part in the design and implementation of frontend and implemented an additional sound visualiser for the voice recognition interface. I also integrated the sound recording and playback system into the app.
